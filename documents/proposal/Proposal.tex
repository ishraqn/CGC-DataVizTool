The Canadian Grain Commission manages a vast amount of data every year. This project aims to help visualize this data in an efficient and user-friendly way. The focus is on creating a visual tool that enables users to upload various data sets and generate engaging visualizations. 

Core features include presenting scientific data through multiple visualization techniques, such as mapping multiple data points, a dynamic legend system to enhance data interpretation, and incorporating interactive elements to explore trends over time. Emphasizing creativity and adaptability, this project seeks to transform raw data into comprehensive geographical maps for the Canadian Grain Commission.

\section*{Problem Statement}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Problem Statement}
The Canadian Grain Commission (CGC) lacks an efficient tool for visualizing complex agricultural data on geographical maps, resulting in inefficiencies in data presentation. Currently, creating maps is a time-consuming process with difficult reproducibility. 

Our project aims to streamline the creation of agricultural visualization tools and provide the CGC with a dedicated platform that assists in the efficient and creative representation of their data. By establishing a robust visual tool, we hope to enhance the interpretation and accessibility of crucial agricultural information. 

\section*{Methodology and Timeline}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Methodology and Timeline}
The first step of the project is to use a public GitHub repository to set up a collaborative environment. This repository will serve as the main hub for monitoring tasks, managing active dev tasks, and organizing deliverables. The configuration of each development environment will be tailored to the specific needs of the project for managing agricultural data, with an emphasis on database and platform choices.  

The implementation of an Agile development technique will be paired with a user-centered design. This strategy makes it possible to make adaptable and flexible adjustments in response to frequent input, ensuring that the tool is in line with the requirements and experiences of non-technical users. To serve a varied user base, important elements like web accessibility standards and user-friendly interfaces will be given priority. 

A well-structured relational database on disk and on memory will be the core of our application, enabling seamless user interaction with agricultural data. These tables will support efficient data storage, integration, and retrieval, allowing for efficient query capabilities while ensuring data accuracy and security. As the project progresses, we will adapt the database schema to handle all forms of data that a user could want to upload to the application. 

Time-series and geographic data management will be accomplished through the use of libraries that are tailored to handle and process geospatial data efficiently. Preprocessing and normalization of data will also be done as part of backend development. To reduce edge cases and facilitate data management, this step is essential as it entails cleaning, converting and standardizing data formats.  

The development of the user interface will prioritize usability for non-technical users with an added option for an Advanced Mode for users needing extra statistics and information. The intuitiveness of the interface will be verified through usability testing and prototyping. There will be plenty of customization choices, including dynamic style options that enable users to change visualization elements like color schemes and intensity and careful considerations will be made to comply with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.  

The system’s architecture will have security and privacy in mind when in development to ensure a robust toolset in production. The system will be continuously monitored, and tests will be implemented to ensure proper safety of user data and proper integration of the system. Maintenance will be done throughout the term to ensure everything is updated and complies with proper licensing when using external libraries. 

There will be clear and comprehensive user manuals available, aimed at non-technical consumers. The architecture and data processing of the system will be described in detail in the technical documentation. The tool's general usability will be improved by providing users with assistance in addressing frequent issues through a troubleshooting guide and FAQ area.

The project will be polished at the last stage, making sure every feature functions as it should. The system will be more versatile and portable thanks to containerization, which will be accomplished via Docker. Frequent check-ins with Sean from Canadian Grain Commission and Professor Robert Guderian will guarantee ongoing development in response to input. The product will be ready for use, guaranteeing simple incorporation into current systems and usability for the intended audience.

The following is the detail of the timeline:

\section*{Infrastructure, facilities and expert personnel requirements}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Infrastructure, facilities and expert personnel requirements}

To ensure the success of this project, we would need access to the data collected and held by the Canadian Grain Commission. Additionally, we would require insights and support from an HCI professional, specifically Dr.\ Patrick Dubois, to ensure a proper user-designed approach. These insights will prove beneficial when we require guidance on decisions outside of our areas of expertise. We have also discussed potential development-focused support from Sean through a colleague from the Canadian Grain Commission. 

We are planning to communicate and establish a connection with Sean’s co-worker over email. We are expected to require additional resources such as the Linux lab, and potential Geographic Information System (GIS) experts such as Dr.\ David Walker from the Riddell Faculty of Environment, Earth, and Resources within the university. However, should we encounter issues in accessing any of these resources we will investigate alternatives such as graduate students in GIS-focused areas of research.
